introduction lumbar fusion common spine surgery often performed relieve symptom related spinal degenerative change stenosis spondylolisthesis however patient complain residual symptom surgery 10–40 rate unsatisfactory result residual symptom include persistent pain motor deficit decreased functional status inability return work decrease strength atrophy back muscle surgery might contribute postsurgical complication postoperative intervention muscle strengthening functional training typically commenced month surgery beginning muscle strengthening early week surgery suggested researcher reported early conditioning trunk muscle would increase muscle strength reduce atrophy thus minimize disability improve quality life patient exercise water compared land reduces load level trunk muscle activity recorded using surface electromyography emg activity performed water reported maximal voluntary contraction mvc level muscle activation lower reported threshold mvc increased risk joint pain injury spine water immersion reduces loading spine buoyancy allows movement normally difficult execute land therefore aquatic trunk exercise considered safe undergone lumbar spine surgery previous study reported aquatic exercise program resulted improved strength quality life reduced pain disability patient low back pain lbp similar effect aquatic exercise intervention also observed patient total knee hip replacement anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction however study investigated effect aquatic exercise patient lumbar fusion surgery therefore study aimed examine effect early aquatic rehabilitation program pain disability trunk muscle strength lumbopelvic stability lumbar multifidus muscle thickness following lumbar spine fusion hypothesized 6-week aquatic rehabilitation program would significantly improve trunk muscle strength lumbopelvic stability muscle thickness reduce pain disability patient undergone lumbar fusion result total participant met inclusion criterion

first study investigate effect early aquatic rehabilitation program pain disability trunk muscle function following lumbar spine fusion data supported hypothesis 6-week aquatic rehabilitation program significantly improving trunk muscle strength lumbopelvic stability muscle thickness reducing pain disability patient lumbar fusion compared home exercise program significant improvement pain score observed experimental group although research performed effect aquatic exercise lumbar fusion similar pain relief effect aquatic exercise intervention observed patient total knee hip replacement research lbp another meta-analysis study shown hydrostatic effect water exercise relieve pain reducing peripheral edema inhibiting activity sympathetic nervous system hence contend aquatic exercise exerts relaxation effect owing water immersion effectively reduces perception pain study found improvement pain control group however previous study shown lumbar stabilization exercise strengthening lumbar muscle reduced pain patient lbp undergone lumbar fusion discrepancy could attributable fact control group performed home exercise program instead supervised exercise intervention study aquatic rehabilitation program home exercise program significantly improved disability score although better result observed aquatic exercise home exercise observed 37.82 decrease odi experimental group better previously reported data dundar randomly assigned patient chronic lbp land-based aquatic-based program result showed aquatic exercise resulted better improvement disability land-based exercise may attributable fact water buoyancy reduces joint compressive force exercise thereby improving confidence patient increasing willingness move spine improved odi score home exercise group may attributable training received performing back exercise finding consistent study reported back exercise training improved odi score patient lumbar fusion surgery tugt assessment tool reflects lower extremity function static dynamic balance patient undergo lumbar fusion assessment also evaluates movement necessary ambulation daily life therefore finding suggested exercise program may helpful improving static dynamic balance land among patient undergo lumbar fusion although experimental group performed 6-week aquatic exercise together home program program may insufficient confer additional benefit patient another study reported aquatic exercise training using water-resistance equipment improved balance walking ability among elderly individual program comprise resistance walking training water hence significant difference observed balance walking ability two group study experimental group exhibited significantly improved trunk extensor strength surgery trunk extensor muscle damaged patient typically afraid land exercise however buoyancy water reduce body weight load muscle help overcome sense fear pain experienced patient typically lead reduced movement thereby enhancing willingness move water addition aquatic environment may allow patient perform exercise reestablish motor control without exacerbating symptom increase trunk muscle strength fusion surgery help patient become confident using back daily activity reduce chance developing disability often caused avoidance behavior although significant between-group difference trunk flexor strength improvement group showed increased trunk flexor strength week exercise significant time effect trunk flexor muscle damaged surgery concern avoidance behavior type exercise showed significant effect improving trunk flexor strength lumbopelvic stability test revealed significant intervention effect patient experimental control group study shown strengthening lumbar stabilizer muscle transverse abdominis multifidus improve trunk control ability bressel psycharakis used emg study trunk muscle activation stability exercise water found aquatic exercise beneficial lower abdominal muscle internal oblique/ transversus abdominis muscle trunk muscle effectively induce contraction lumbopelvic stabilizer muscle muscle water evidence support effect aquatic exercise lumbopelvic stability recent study conducted reported hip abductor strengthening exercise increase size muscle movement exercise similar exercise program might explain significant improvement size muscle experimental group bressel indicated hip abduction movement water affect trunk balance maintaining trunk balance water enables greater activation muscle although affected muscle lumbar fusion previous researcher reported lumbar surgery one important cause atrophy back muscle muscle bipennate structure fiber crossing one two even three vertebra level thus even patient undergo lumbar fusion surgery train upper lower section muscle achieve training effect several limitation study may partially interfere result first study lacked long-term follow-up unclear whether observed improvement could maintained longer period time second study blinded thus outcome could entirely exclude bias measurement result finally although exercise frequency participant control group recorded therapist supervised exercise whereas participant experimental group supervised twice received aquatic exercise training hence unclear whether positive effect attributable hydrotherapy supervision method trial design experimental

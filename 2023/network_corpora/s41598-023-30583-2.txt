since wake covid-19 pandemic phenomenal amount research undertaken effectiveness various non-pharmaceutical intervention npis reduce infection rate hospitalization death however existing evidence

one region unsurprisingly estimated effect npis also vary greatly existing literature based context studied statistical methodology used covid-19 outcome question thus debate effectiveness npis fighting pandemic far resolved currently undergoing public inquiry government handling covid expert divided whether lockdown could avoided versus believe life lost due delayed lockdown since humanity expect pandemic occur frequently future done past better positioned leverage better quality data contribute debate estimating causal impact implementing lockdown sweden excess death outcome using data human mortality database hmd synthetic control method scm compared average number death previous year swede died year substantial number excess country approximately 10.3 million inhabitant increase excess death common phenomenon around globe pandemic quick glance number suggests sweden experienced substantially excess death compared similar country sweden posed similar policy recommendation

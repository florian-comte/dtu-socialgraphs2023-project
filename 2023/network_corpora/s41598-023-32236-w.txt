introduction development widespread availability generative artificial intelligence tool chatgpt http midjourney http sparked lively debate numerous aspect integration society well nature creativity human one key issue surrounding implementation technology pertains potential impact job market system becoming increasingly capable performing task solely within purview human concern raised potential displacement job implication future employment prospect field education question raised ethical pedagogical implication technology well concern system might reduce critical thinking skill another aspect debate involves legal ethical ramification ai-generated content tool produce increasingly sophisticated work ranging article artistic creation raise issue whether ai-generated product granted

common illogical trial human received max rating lower never received low rating suggests instead generating new idea human overrepresented producing common low-quality response based controlled-attention theory creativity seems weakness human creative thinking compared chatbots lie executive function several way human executive function may failed example human may difficulty

ruled may assume chatbots executed task always best capability computational point view however overall superiority solely explained low executive performance human superiority still evident even lowest performing human considered see additional analysis supplementary material associative theory creativity individual differ structure semantic memory creativity linked flexible highly connected semantic network exactly clear semantic network represented memory current chatbots speed accessing large data structure whether flexible may explain higher-level average performance compared average human performance however semantic distance score chatbots best response always systematically larger best human thus highly creative individual likely posse flexible semantic network still compete activating distant weakly related concept one question arises result chatgpt4 newest efficient chatbot currently available performed well according human raters compared human chatbots according

introduction although incidence breast cancer increase every year early-stage breast cancer patient undergo standardized treatment five-year survival rate high rapid development modern medical treatment technology life expectancy breast cancer patient markedly increased considered treating breast cancer lie extending survival time patient also improving quality life reducing postoperative complication increasing disease-free survival time relevant study early-stage breast cancer patient proved safety effectiveness specified breast-conserving surgery bcs one important objective bcs improve postoperative cosmetic effect therefore periareolar incision advantage quick recovery small scar relatively better invisibility surgical scar relatively postoperative complication compared traditional axillary lymph node dissection mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection malnd reduces intraoperative hemorrhage volume shortens postoperative drain removal time average daily drainage

improve quality life patient postoperative body image breast cancer patient severely affect wellbeing sensitive patient requirement surgery almost invisible surgical scar least obvious deformity breast therefore case patient doctor decide surgical incision bcs resect tumor also benefit suitable cosmetic effect make surgical scar invisible evident incision usually applied close axillary wrinkle lower breast wrinkle formed natural mastoptosis breast periareolar area incision position offer best cosmetic effect periareolar technique resect quadrant tumor including benign breast tumor even bcs surgery far nac periareolar incision advantage quick recovery small scar relatively better invisibility surgical scar good cosmetic effect relatively postoperative complication tumor non-central area tissue behind areola kept present approach surgical incision rarely exceed 1/4 perimeter areola avoid damage blood vessel flap much possible therefore complication nac ischemia rarely occur size areola directly affect length incision thus ensure surgical operation vision scope incision exceeds quadrant however ensure blood supply nac affected size periareolar incision exceed half total perimeter areola tumor far areola located periphery gland important resect tumor outer gland slightly pushed outside tumor toward nac surgery unclear whether tumor touched tumor accurately located body surface via ultrasound patient surgical position fixed crucial accurately resect tumor cut normal gland possible needed change breast appearance premise superficial basal negative

obtain satisfactory cosmetic effect endoscope-aided technique application breast-conserving surgery mainly resolved problem notorious auxiliary incision scar seen traditional breast-conserving surgery combined axillary lymph node dissection mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection become widely used surgical option axillary lymph node dissection breast cancer patient literature show patient undergo mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection postoperative recovery time short incidence complication including upper limb edema paresthesia evidently lower traditional axillary lymph node dissection mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection axillary nerve blood vessel lymph tube magnified 8–10 time via endoscope allows seeing lymph node axillary vein thoracodorsal nerve blood vessel intercostobrachial nerve lymph tube procedure dissection also mostly retains intercostobrachial nerve avoids damage blood vessel nerve lymph tube evidently reduces intraoperative hemorrhage postoperative hemorrhage shortens postoperative time indwelling drainage tube lower risk incidence postoperative upper limb edema paresthesia outcome improve patient postoperative survival quality life procedure mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection establishment axillary space become one key aspect narrow small axillary space usually established inflation axillary space established traditional inflation relatively unstable surgical vision reduced due air leakage moreover mist produced hemorrhage minute blood vessel hemostasis electric hook small space result blur lens severely

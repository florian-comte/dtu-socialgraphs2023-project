introduction patient safety reporting system provide mechanism healthcare provider staff including frontline clinician nurse technician report patient safety error concern several categorization scheme defining type error reported patient safety error range event harm occurs patient e.g. near miss close call event patient harmed e.g. adverse event reporting system vary site however report typically composed structured data free text description actual safety issue promise reporting system potential dramatically improve safety quality care exposing possible vulnerability care process documenting information near miss adverse event many provider organization promoted use system still barrier reporting many clinician enter report provider organization amassing large database effectively analyzing event potential new insight safety hazard reside also opportunity combine data across different provider organization identify pattern may visible looking data single organization patient safety organization psos legally secure environment analyzing safety data provide opportunity identify broader trend organization manually review significant case involve patient harm conduct root cause analysis review technique make small percent total number report many organization number report grown ten thousand even hundred thousand psos number report million majority safety report unanalyzed recognized safety hazard yet reached level patient harm undetected patient safety risk analyst buried large number patient safety event pse report major shortcoming given clinician taking time report data available opportunity apply machine learning technique improve analysis pse report data used effectively identify patient safety pattern trend intervention developed address trend objective study examine whether natural language processing nlp used better categorize pse report focus medication related report categorization report medication error type background medication safety event report looking composition pse report database medication safety event often frequently reported patient safety report type often associated greatest harm patient consequently improving analysis report semi-automated approach likely significant impact given volume report may need reviewed acted upon first step analyzing medication related pse report determine type medication error described report semi-automatically categorizing medication related report appropriate medication error type natural place apply computational technique given importance understanding type medication error well-defined medication error category already exist natural language processing nlp automatic method categorize report high level nlp probability based method detect pattern text categorize based pattern nlp used extensively healthcare analyze clinical document identify specific healthcare condition identifying drug mining electronic health record well several application realize tremendous value nlp analysis pse report important understand nature pse report report generally contains structured information time site occurrence e.g. emergency department blood bank role participant e.g. physician nurse technician patient demographic e.g. age gender well classification severity type event e.g. death harm near-miss type event general category label fall medication lab etc event category vary institution even vary within institution depending whether reporting system used addition structured data element report also include unstructured free-text field reporter provide narrative describing safety event greater detail reporter contextualize safety event near miss documenting contributing factor circumstance surrounding event information captured structured field free-text field provide incredible value organization looking minimize system-based risk given pse report generally rich free text response various nlp technique extract health medical concept relationship negation tense causation lend expediting analysis large number report removing need analyst read report previous work demonstrated nlp technique implemented workflow improve patient safety growing focus medication safety important understand similar technique used understand prevent medication error medication error type category commonly used taxonomy describe medication error national coordinating council medication error reporting prevention ncc merp taxonomy taxonomy composed several different category specific type medication error e.g. wrong drug wrong rate etc one commonly used part taxonomy nearly medication related pse report categorized medication error type somewhere reporting analysis process categorization may performed reporter entering port and/or

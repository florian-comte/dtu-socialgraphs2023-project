introduction diagnosis classification extent severity periodontal disease crucial clinician determine patient treatment prognosis also essential researcher investigate pathogenesis effectiveness various treatment expert updated diagnostic criterion classify severity extent based emerging evidence environmental systemic risk factor influence criterion revised four time since first diagnostic classification recent one proposed american academy periodontology aap european federation periodontology efp new diagnostic classification intends facilitate documentation diagnosis general dental practice periodontal disease diagnosed managed however study reported gap implementing classification clinical setting expected transitioning new diagnostic system addition considerable variation exist among dental practitioner dental student use system could lead under- over-estimation therefore research clarify grey zone new previous diagnostic classification necessary facilitate improved understanding consistency diagnosing periodontal case using classification system significant contribution diagnostic classification establishment simple objective criterion diagnose gingivitis case

treatment planning among clinician occur use new system recent study assessed practitioner understanding classification system reported gingivitis case proved challenging 65–95 periodontal specialist general practitioner incorrectly diagnosing healthy gingiva case biofilm induced gingivitis study result quantify extent soft tissue inflammatory change could present among healthy gingiva case finding could facilitate dental clinician researcher diagnose patient case bop healthy even presence visual sign gingival inflammation moreover training calibration session necessary enable consistent use new diagnostic classification lastly computational approach generated diagnosis finding retrieved diagnostic information clinical note enabled studying larger population patient data program could used future study prognosis change disease status among patient diagnosed gingivitis healthy gingiva using diagnostic classification discus key point study detail difference diagnosing gingivitis using bop versus visual assessment bop patient classified healthy gingival tissue could actually bop inherent gingival inflammation exhibiting sign swelling redness tenderness palpation understand one rationale new diagnostic criterion differentiate gingivitis site versus described gingivitis case however inconsistency clinician researcher diagnosis using new classification system could lead under- over-estimation disease gingivitis precursor periodontitis reversed diagnosed early thus important diagnose manage gingivitis early prevent progression periodontitis therefore periodic training calibration clinician researcher critical facilitate correct use new diagnostic system even criterion easy use objective measure inaccuracy diagnosis could limit advantage using new diagnostic system using ehr data validate case definition determining edr data quality described study medicine validated various disease classification using ehr data large population similarly study illustrates strength using edr data study effect new case definition may difficult pursue prospective study despite promising potential using edr data research important evaluate quality edr data intended use since edr data collected research patient care study determined accuracy clinician-recorded diagnosis comparing expert reviewer diagnosis result demonstrated excellent agreement indicating high accuracy reliability gingivitis diagnosis information documented edr high data quality attributed regular training calibration session diagnosis treatment planning performed among faculty resident iusd department periodontology high reliability edr data indicates importance incorporating training calibration session dental clinician part discipline continuing education enhance consistency clinical assessment documentation across different clinical setting role computational method process large-size data retrieve finding clinical note study required processing approximately million observation rate least periodontal charting observation per patient using computational approach addition used text mining approach retrieve diagnosis written clinical note thus study would possible without using computational approach process large-size data accurately efficiently manual processing big data would required considerable time effort potential error previous study reported retrieving periodontal data radiograph ass change disease status data completeness radiographic bone loss nevertheless computational nlp approach developed study valuable resource researcher clinician determine diagnosis periodontal data well edr clinical note possible apply automated approach developed study different datasets private practice data determine national prevalence gingivitis like nhanes study approach could alternative nhanes study nhanes reported performing prevalence study due high cost involved conducting clinical examination large population limitation future work like study limitation exist study first included patient gingivitis periodontitis current classification discriminates gingivitis patient intact periodontium reduced periodontium aim determine percentage patient healthy gingiva diagnosed using classification also visual sign inflammation previously used diagnose gingivitis next study dataset included patient received coe january december chose time long-term goal compare patient population periodontitis prevalence national prevalence used time another limitation patient data collected student clinic potential variation certain finding even though calibrated faculty review finding next differentiate plaque-induced gingivitis non-plaque induced gingivitis excluded periodontal charting information collected patient third molar could treated gingivitis lastly inclusion edr data one institution limited generalizability result future differentiate plaque induced gingivitis non-plaque induced gingivitis case also determine influence factor smoking bop outcome gingivitis patient conclusion study demonstrated significant number patient diagnosed healthy gingiva according diagnostic classification could visual sign inflammation change gingival color redness volume swelling result highlight potential variation among clinician diagnosing gingivitis using new classification thus leading under- over-estimation gingivitis case periodic training calibration clinician dental student researcher lead consistent use new diagnostic system study also demonstrated significance utilizing edr data research informatics approach developed study provide basis apply patient care data academic institution community practice generate diagnosis periodontal charting data retrieve diagnosis recorded free text clinical note finally also conclude calibration practice institution significantly improved consistency diagnosis treatment planning result study indicate training calibration session could lead better documentation

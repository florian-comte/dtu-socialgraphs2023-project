difficult identify trait consistently predict invasiveness proportion introduced specie ultimately become invasive estimated lower percent perplexing question invasion ecology certain specie become invasive others invasion success may depend pre-adaptations present native range character evolving novo introduction various interaction two factor invasive ant highly prolific invader among world damaging pest invasive ant commonly share suite trait including multiqueen colony structure extensive polydomy success anthropogenic habitat many invasive ant specie form supercolonies extremely large

growth subsequent inheritance daughter queen linage ant secondary polygyny occurs originally monogynous colony becomes polygynous later life cycle generally result accepting daughter queen currently present queen colony and/or colony fusion one potential pathway evolution supercolonies merger multiple smaller colony occupying certain area form single supercolony merger could two monogynous colony form polygynous colony two polygynous colony form much larger competitively superior polygynous colony previous research shown non-aggressive humile colony attained greater productivity merged alternative pathway supercolonies develop time smaller colony colony grow spread new area via budding research date suggests colony merger generally occur supercolonies develop time smaller colony favorable environmental condition ant factor including territoriality well-established foraging range natural artificial barrier sometimes large geographic distance colony may limit opportunity mixing different colony however factor including reproduction budding extreme vagility constant internest exchange individual movement propagules human may promote opportunity mixing potential merger result suggest successful colony merger may occur laboratory condition unlikely occur natural population given high level relatedness within urban colony including highly polygynous one urban colony sessile mainland usa introduced colony hawaii many way similar introduced colony supercolonial invasive ant specie often exhibit extreme polygyny polydomy form large supercolonies become dominant pest one

similarity likely merge similar process may happening sessile however based result blumenfeld colony merger due genetic and/or cuticular hydrocarbon similarity unlikely occur wild non-laboratory colony sessile phylogenetic chemical analysis performed blumenfeld natural urban sessile colony uncovered clear differentiation among geographic locality natural urban population suggesting merger unlikely occur field situation aggression assay worker queen revealed high level aggression injurious aggression interaction worker immediately attacked foreign queen behavioral observation indicate aggression entirely one-sided worker attacked queen queen attempted flee suggests established colony unlikely accept foreign queen may accidentally stray territory established colony budding event mating flight unintentional transport human contrast high aggression worker-worker worker-queen interaction aggression completely absent queen-queen interaction plausible colony merger may occur situation high worker aggression lead elimination aggressive worker phenotype selective survival queen increasing chance fusion however unclear worker produced colony resulting fusion unrelated queen would display homogenized recognition cue non-aggressive behavior whether would aggressive towards aggression assay ant almost exclusively performed worker ant worker leave nest engage wide range intra- inter-specific interaction queen typically sedentary remain safety nest rarely venture outside however many polygynous ant specie including sessile humile queen frequently travel trail alongside worker occasionally engage independent foraging therefore queen may engage interaction unrelated colony may important factor mediating interaction mutually aggressive colony including potential colony merger current result advocate use queen aggression assay worker-queen queen-queen aggression assay may important assessing potential merger mutually aggressive colony method

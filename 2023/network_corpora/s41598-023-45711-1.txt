process developed geo-survey tool shown enable assessment respondent spatial orientation skill ability read navigate cartographic material locating geographical feature developed tool used research study rely modern technology explore problem associated geographic education spatial orientation application offer unique feature unavailable competitive solution including ability precisely configure base map well automated data analysis module facilitates statistical processing ranking result application tested performing proof-of-concept survey aimed verify whether type used background map affected spatial orientation skill group student conducted geosurvey revealed although surveyed young adult well versed using technology navigate urban system despite fact navigation usually relies labeled topographic map respondent found much easier navigate unlabeled orthophotomap detailed topographic map result indicate presenting real-world color shape spatial feature aerial image street network better facilitate identification specific object study also demonstrated self-reported knowledge given area fact respondent resided area always correlated ability find relevant place object map obtained result also suggest prolonged exposure abstract representation reality combination automated navigation smartphone device significant effect respondent innate navigation skill shown superior performance reading orthophotomap versus abstract topographic map would indicate spatial imagination turn spatial orientation affected omnipresent technology data suggests future research spatial orientation may produce insightful result performed using orthophotomaps result post-survey indicate system functionality could improved according respondent short tutorial use drawing tool would improve user experience future geosurvey design module similar response module could introduced generate geosurveys user-friendly interface solution could enable development geo-survey application web platform enabling online design conduction geosurveys functionality could implemented without increasing architectural complexity application would mean would remain easily modifiable adaptable specific need research could also facilitate optimization approach assessing spatial orientation skill various scale different social group

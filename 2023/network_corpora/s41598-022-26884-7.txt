introduction human need adapt behavior result risk previous research shown risk coping attitude partly heritable gene involved regulation dopaminergic system good candidate explain heritability risk behavior however many report gene behavior association based small-sample candidate gene found contrasting result leading debate scientific community overcome limitation genome-wide association study gwas based million individual identified locus associated general risk tolerance surprisingly none identified locus close gene involved dopamine pathway bioinformatic analysis pointed role gene expressed brain region involved decision-making although gene involved dopamine biosynthesis receptor drd1,2,3 reach statistical significance yet evidence brain region dopamine neurotransmitter play

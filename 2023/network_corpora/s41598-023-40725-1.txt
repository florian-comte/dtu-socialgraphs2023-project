data panel survey study found policy designed promote vaccination positively correlated social norm vaccination intention better establish causal effect conducted four preregistered experiment one

effect represents standard mechanism underlies use policy influence behavior two mechanism i.e. informational normative used understand policy shape behavior shaping norm study demonstrated policy exerted informational normative influence promote vaccination outcome clear much result might generalize policy vaccine study focused policy ease behavior without necessarily rewarding recommending vaccination increasing vaccination funding police pair negative behavior punishment e.g. restricting one ability work travel one chooses vaccinate may similar effect norm due potential psychological reactance however recent study found social distancing measure introduced pandemic stronger impact social norm government announcement danger social interaction likewise possible effect policy might

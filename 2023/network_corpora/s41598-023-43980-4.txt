appreciation term amusement emotional state experiencing something funny component humor appreciation like perceived offensiveness boringness investigated predictor amusement factor influence whether someone amused humor stimulus divided different category one category nature joke including content structural quality early theory suggested joke certain content funnier others tie closely supposed reason laughing instance freud suggested cathartic function joke laughter valve releasing tension societally suppressed drive towards sex aggression thus hypothesis formed sometimes supported sexual aggressive humor stimulus funnier others fact even earlier theorizing suggests instance humor consist satisfactory domination others theory posit people likely laugh joke elicits strong manageable cognitive violation distinction surprisingness/incongruity see joke strong elaboration potential i.e. many funny implication zoom theory state joke simply funnier others imply predict amusement one evaluate good respective joke parallel stream empirical evidence sometimes coming group researcher showing characteristic audience member also predictive humor appreciation short people laugh joke whereas others remain hard amuse one differential trait come humor appreciation person dispositional cheerfulness temperamental basis humor often used synonymously fragmented term sense humor much like person mood e.g. cheerfulness dispositional baseline well time-varying component observed aligned people appreciation humor stimulus prominent personality construct linked person general level humor appreciation include big five personality trait specifically extraverted conscientious open-minded emotionally stable people shown heightened level humor appreciation albeit consistently positive relationship likely restricted personality- coherent humor stimulus e.g. neurotic people specifically disliking absurd humor similarly sensation-seekers appreciate nonsensical humor whereas counterpart prefer humor clear uncertainty-resolving punchline proposed explanation author highlight nonsense humor involves stronger cognitive stimulation thereby dividing sensation-seekers avoiders comparable humor appreciation humor production divided across personality dimension instance extravert produce affiliative humor whereas agreeable people tend produce non-aggressive humor next mood personality people capability predict humor appreciation specifically people higher competence producing funny joke rated humorous cartoon comparatively low potentially due heightened desire dominance humor production opposed submission/affiliation humor appreciation thus broad string research focus attribute audience predicting amusement rather merely scoring content joke note listed finding beyond simple person-effects advance interaction person characteristic characteristic joke e.g. aggressive person enjoying aggressive joke similarly work focusing stimulus difference often acknowledges notion interactivity instance freud gave example people differing habitual suppression urge turn affected sense humor proposed advantage specific joke content like sex violence merely due observation suppression urge common thus rendering joke content effective average short theory humor appreciation claim exclusively joke exclusively nature listener determines amusement question merely degree two source interaction contribute variance-decomposition study icc value ascribed higher importance raters stimulus came funniness rating even variance pooling variance specific rater stimulus pair suggested totality interaction effect harbor highest predictive power remains determined specific effect account finding accurate resulting prediction model especially applied outside training sample importance person-stimulus interaction also highlighted humor appreciation theory like benign violation theory posit amusement requires simultaneous categorization joke violating benign judgment influenced rater specific relationship joke content current set study review practical usefulness person-level predictor stimulus-level predictor interaction building cutting-edge machine learning system trained predict people appreciation humor content predictive accuracy practical relevance traditionally psychological science focus offering coherent explanation human behavior usually achieved accumulating mapping empirical observation causal theory many theory imply pattern statistical association two relevant measurement theory often state one measure predict i.e. non-zero statistical association usually pre-defined cut-off accurate prediction support theory example various finding suggest bad quality sleep associated depression suicide theorist might wonder

practical usefulness regarding humor machine learning system focused humor detection meaning model automatically infer text image meant convey humor interestingly state-of-the-art performance humor

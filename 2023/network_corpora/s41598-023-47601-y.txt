national brucellosis exposure assessment kenya designed representative national level coupled risk factor assessment risk mapping thus gaining comprehensive epidemiological picture expanding understanding animal brucellosis exposure pattern diverse kenyan territory found consistent pattern higher exposure among adult animal female raised primarily pastoralism addition risk mapping confirmed disease risk concentrated mainly hard-to-reach arid semi-arid land asals occupying three-quarters country land surface home human livestock wildlife population respectively although developing country made remarkable progress brucellosis control vast endemic area kenya limit proper surveillance control system calling concerted effort launch one health -led control program tailored reality particular geographical socio-cultural context high seroprevalence found drier agroecological zone consistent finding study conducted smaller geographical location zone pastoralist community keep livestock communally large mobile herd constantly searching pasture water thereby sharing common environment unfortunately management practice brings infected aborting birthing animal close contact susceptible livestock promoting transmission brucella since pastoralism way life community study beginning characterize livestock movement network could inform disease prevention control practice policy indeed previous study established strong correlation human brucellosis region brucella seroprevalence livestock engaging risky practice promote brucella infection specifically pastoralists consume raw milk infected animal constantly shed bacteria milk also assist infected animal parturition without protective clothing equipment low brucellosis seroprevalence high agricultural potential agro-alpine zone high medium potential zone considerably lower seroprevalence drier asal zone relative national prevalence 6.8 low seroprevalence linked husbandry system focus intensifying milk production targeting high-value market nearby urbanizing region intensification response increasing human population density land scarcity pushing livestock farmer keep high-value livestock breed stall-feeding system limiting between-herd contact thus tremendously decreasing transmission risk brucella via placental fetal tissue urine furthermore production system zone employ biosecurity measure cull animal poor reproductive performance minimize introduction animal outside farm within-herd replacement breeding animal also curtails within-herd spread brucella human risk map generated inform research effectiveness efficacy singular combined preventive intervention shifting away costly one-size-fits-all control strategy demotivate policymakers towards focused management based risk stratification thus map holistic instrument multifaceted strategy may instance inform pilot vaccination study community-based trialing public health education promotion risk brucella spp exposure higher female male adult juvenile cattle finding consistent previous study primarily attributed longer exposure time among female due role providing replacement animal milk production additionally pastoralist community bull calf often disposed early age leaving male breeding herd typically consist male kenya implementing national brucellosis control strategy strategy background rationale motivated livestock-dependent economy country landmass besides reducing threat human health although study excluded populous brucellosis-susceptible small stock data show distribution pattern brucella spp exposure indicate probable economic impact animal brucellosis country sufficient motivate policymakers increase funding control measure moreover previous study estimated positive economic benefit cost-effectiveness control measure undertaken brucellosis-endemic setting elsewhere surprisingly many country drawn brucellosis eradication program employing vaccination-only policy others using test-and-slaughter-only policy using approach complementing measure likely reflects occupation culture prevalent particular locality little consideration given role human-livestock-environment interface interdependency facilitate disease transmission follows village-level community health volunteer community animal health worker team attentive particular social cultural livestock husbandry disease control context form cornerstone integrating socio-cultural environment one health practice remote hard-to-reach zone anthropology provide important additional context one health practice often overlook perspective lived experience community affected zoonosis spillover human strategy would contribute achieving sustainable development goal united nation focus equity commitment attending people health hard-to-reach area policy expert modelling exercise suggest vaccination effort alone insufficient take nearly three decade control brucellosis effectively31 even abortus s19 vaccine recommended live attenuated vaccine female calf aged month age group highly treasured pastoralists administered single subcutaneous dose reduced dose organism adult cattle vaccine effectively reduces incidence brucellosis cattle herds31 thus government would well pilot pastoralist herd value female cattle male ssa country yet adopt vaccination comprehensive brucellosis

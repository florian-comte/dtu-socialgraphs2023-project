introduction despite decade attempt improve nature conservation degradation biodiversity continued even worsened worldwide awareness human value nature reason preserve still insufficient beginning second millenary attempt improve concept ecosystem service recently reframed larger concept nature contribution people ncps intergovernmental science-policy platform biodiversity ecosystem service ipbes developed aim bending curve biodiversity loss highlighting potential value socio-economic development well-being human although ncps fully interchangeable term sake clarity adopt terminology common international classification cices basis select ncps study however whereas protected area established worldwide preserve endangered specie habitat necessarily designed preserve associated ecosystem service cultural value despite included definition protected area proposed iucn thus need map ncps spatially e.g include spatial conservation prioritization large effort made map ncps geographic space include spatial conservation planning yet mapping ncp often performed level coarse landscape unit e.g ecosystem habitat unit etc tend blur complexity relation specie ncps e.g use conifer decideous tree layer distinction specie characterize timber production moreover study combining specie ncps either comparing opposing separate feature however global change impact specie

table first important step toward predicting ncps specie attributing value else every relationship prove difficult example attributing negative relationship grey wolf canis lupus reduction specie damage disease vector specie ncp table seen extremely controversial instance large predator grey wolf regulate specie potential vector disease inducing land use perturbation e.g elk alces americanus

future study however attributing one three possible information value else useful first step may sufficiently reflect nature e.g intensity relationship illustrated sparrow passer genus wild boar sus

expert pers comm. table reflect current knowledge therefore must used interpreted caution also acknowledging remaining unknown uncertainty future development could attempt using real number instead fill table translate intensity positive negative contribution different specie ncp instance better account also different role importance specie ecosystem functioning provided sufficient information

detrimental human wellbeing black locust robinia pseudoacacia harm natural ecosystem also positive attribute soil stabilization nitrogen fixation consumable plant human herd rotproof wood development could also integrate ncps scenic beauty relation soil nutrient nitrogen phosphorus carbon content similarly aquatic ncps could also considered i.e oxygen supplier however insufficient information found complement table appendix see data availability cices classification would permit reproduce methodology sufficiently documented species-ncp system world lastly would interesting relate single

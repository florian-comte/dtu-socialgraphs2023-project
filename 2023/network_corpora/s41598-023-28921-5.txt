standardized practice strategy medical prescription discussion critical influence several factor player behavior evolutionary game utilizing evolutionary game approach examine medical malpractice within context information asymmetry bounded rationality developed model evolutionary game physician patient state administration regulation model simulated establishing dynamic equation evolutionary stabilization strategy important note policy implication drawn conclusion contingent upon hypothesis posited model research finding highlight critical influence several factor player behavior evolutionary game namely advantage doctor standardized practice strength government regulation patient perception based research finding governmental action aimed addressing medical malpractice outlined follows first need adapt regulatory framework government reevaluate suitability existing medical malpractice handling framework context physician–patient dispute china entail timely adjustment regulatory structure tailoring regulatory focus according unique characteristic different province city year medical malpractice incident occur diverse regulatory method employed application vary based multiple dimension including standardized illegal practice doctor patient cooperation conflict strategy patient-related medical issue approach would enhance precision effectiveness regulation second intensity regulation concerning illegal medical practice patient-related medical issue calibrated reasonably diverse array regulatory method result evolutionary game demonstrate provision medical service medical practitioner weigh benefit cost choose strategy patient medical treatment decision however excessive regulatory force discourage medical practitioner selecting standardized practice strategy reality excessive government regulation medical behavior particularly relation medical prescription reduce patient medical trouble behavior may weaken patient influence turn may create ideal practice environment medical practitioner conducive long-term development medical service may increase likelihood medical practitioner resorting illegal practice hence striking balance regulation safeguarding patient right essential fostering harmonious physician–patient relationship third establishment information management system physician patient crucial currently lack publicly accessible individual medical malpractice statistic central government official website china therefore imperative construct web-based information platform healthcare incident prevention management information service platform enable government public access real-time healthcare incident control would facilitate immediate disclosure medical malpractice case efficient management medical malpractice database reduction government regulatory cost lastly worth noting doctor-patient game theory government-regulated medical malpractice also consider influence health insurance policy strategic choice various stakeholder including pharmaceutical company consequently comprehensive analysis diverse scenario within model remains challenging endeavor study serf foundational exploration effective management multi-party medical malpractice laying groundwork research domain method underlying assumption model construction study address two distinct subject within context doctor-patient dispute government regulation healthcare practitioner patient throughout process doctor-patient dispute party make strategic choice umbrella government regulation real-life scenario healthcare provider patient exhibit bounded rationality meaning posse complete information strategic choice due information asymmetry consequently party continually learn successful strategy employed prior doctor-patient dispute government regulation adjust choice maximize benefit ultimately reaching stable model outcome aligns assumption bounded rationality mutation selection principle evolutionary game theory hence evolutionary game theory prof valuable tool examining strategic choice made healthcare practitioner patient doctor-patient dispute government regulation evolutionary game model encompasses two group participant physician patient physician behavior categorized standardized practice illegal practice well cooperation conflict patient behavior divided non-medical malpractice medical malpractice standardized practice physician involves adhering law regulation ensure patient safety treatment quality contrast illegal practice doctor encompass action over-treating patient prescribing expensive medication unnecessarily failing fulfill duty care delaying treatment among others collaborative strategy involve physician partnering patient facilitate cooperative treatment throughout patient care continuum emphasizing effective communication well-planned treatment choice conversely conflict strategy denote situation cooperation break patient non-malpractice behavior signifies choice engage malpractice given varying strategy employed physician foundational assumption model many study often make direct assumption study adopts grounded approach drawing previous research aligning real-world scenario based tort liability law people republic china regulation prevention handling medical malpractice relevant law regulation fundamental assumption model outlined follows hypothesis proportion physician adopting standardized practice denoted proportion engaging irregular practice represented similarly percentage physician opting collaborative strategy expressed opting conflicting approach patient percentage involved medical malpractice denoted engaged medical malpractice likelihood physician selecting conflict strategy denoted final evolutionary outcome physician chooses strategy irregular practice conflict practice patient selects non-medical malpractice patient payoff positive given physician choice irregular practice conflict practice conversely probability physician choosing conflict strategy final outcome physician opts strategy irregular practice conflict practice patient selects medical malpractice patient payoff negative given physician choice irregular practice conflict practice weight assigned physician standardized practice collaborative strategy physician–patient interaction denoted respectively hypothesis hospital may engage illegal practice maximize profit often expense patient unethical practice may include administering medically unnecessary treatment prescribing excessively priced medication unscrupulous tactic benefit derived practice surpass standardized practice condition furthermore physician may select different strategy cooperation conflict medical malpractice occurs resulting distinct outcome healthcare cost conflict physician patient exceeds collaboration however choice different strategies—cooperation conflict—between doctor patient yield varying effect patient medical service process benefit cooperation doctor patient far outweigh conflict hypothesis according article tort liability law people republic china patient suffers harm medical diagnosis treatment activity resulting medical malpractice constitutes case medical malpractice case medical institution healthcare practitioner exhibit negligence medical institution becomes liable compensating incurred damage concurrently administrative authority oversee penalize unlawful medical practice conducted physician following provision article regulation prevention handling medical malpractice many patient express dissatisfaction compensation received following experience medical malpractice patient receive anticipated compensation regular channel legal defense may resort pursuing additional compensation employing medical malpractice strategy medical malpractice process patient document expense related transportation lost wage cost patient medical malpractice behavior occurs within framework standardized medical prescription lead significant negative societal impact behavior may tarnish physician reputation disrupt normal order diagnosis treatment infringe upon medical right interest consequently government department exercise stricter regulation medical malpractice behavior scenario upon investigation determined healthcare practitioner engaged illegal practice case even though patient medical malpractice conduct negatively influence medical prescription patient also expose physician violation process result government exercise lesser control medical malpractice behavior specific context hypothesis instance physician–patient medical malpractice patient expectation regarding medical treatment strategy treatment outcome treatment cost factor influence medical malpractice behavior essentially cognitive decision patient hold high expectation medical treatment strategy treatment outcome treatment cost etc. posse heightened level cognition likely engage medical malpractice behavior higher degree cognition stem belief benefit generated doctor treatment strategy conversely patient low expectation medical treatment strategy treatment outcome treatment cost etc. indicating lower degree cognition prone medical malpractice behavior lower degree cognition result poor treatment outcome subsequently poorer perceived benefit leading instance medical malpractice patient medical malpractice behavior diminish physician standing within community disrupt standard medical procedure potentially cause form harm physician practicing within confines law patient medical malpractice behavior likely expose illegal practice consequently physician may come scrutiny state regulatory body medium various social group leading heightened damage furthermore medical malpractice incident escalate disrupt healthcare system also adverse repercussion societal harmony stability social status physician patient trust based aforementioned
